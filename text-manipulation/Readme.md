# Text manipulation

## Purpose

To extract the content of a release note and only thanks contributors of bugs or features.

it's a random topic, but it is to show how to manipulate some text.

A release note has been downloaded locally and both the bash script or the golang code parse it the same way to congratulate the developers who stated that they either fixed a `bug` or worked on a `feature`.

## Run

### Bash 

run `./script.sh`


### Golang

run `go mod tidy` then `go run .`
